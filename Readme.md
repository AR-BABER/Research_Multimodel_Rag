# Multi-Modal RAG Research & Implementation

A comprehensive exploration of Multi-Modal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems, focusing on understanding and implementing different approaches to handle various modalities including text, images, video, and audio.

## Core Concepts

### Multi-Modal Embeddings
- Creates modality-independent vector representations
- Enables unified vector space for different content types (text, images, video, audio)
- Allows cross-modal similarity search and retrieval
- Can be achieved through:
  1. Training a single multi-modal embedding model
  2. Unifying different specialized embedding models

### Image Understanding in LLMs
- **Image Embedding vs Vision Models**
  - Image embedding models: Convert image to single vector
  - Vision models: Process images in patches for detailed understanding
- **Document Understanding**
  - Feature extraction through patches
  - OCR extraction
  - Spatial cues awareness (e.g., DocLLM)
  - Hidden information detection capabilities

## Multi-Modal RAG Approaches

### Option 1: Direct Multi-Modal Approach
- Uses multi-modal embeddings for both images and text
- Retrieves content using similarity search
- Passes raw images and text to multi-modal LLM
- **Pros**: Direct approach
- **Cons**: Requires sophisticated multi-modal embedding model

### Option 2: Image-to-Text Conversion
- Converts images to text summaries using multi-modal LLM
- Embeds and retrieves text only
- Uses text-only LLM for synthesis
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation
- **Cons**: May lose visual nuances

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Extracts features from images using multi-modal LLM
- Embeds summaries while maintaining raw image references
- Passes both raw images and text to multi-modal LLM
- **Pros**: 
  - Best balance of efficiency and accuracy
  - Doesn't require multi-modal embedding model
  - Maintains original context
- **Cons**: More complex implementation

## Implementation Details

### Document Processing with Unstructured Library
Supports multiple document types:
- Text files (.txt)
- Office documents (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx)
- PDFs with various partitioning strategies:
  - "auto": Automatic strategy selection
  - "hi_res": High-resolution layout analysis
  - "ocr_only": Image text extraction
  - "fast": Quick text extraction
- Images (.png, .jpg, .heic)
- Emails, web pages, e-books, etc.

### Storage Architecture
- **Document Store**: Raw content storage
- **Vector Store**: Embedding storage
- **Linking Mechanism**: Metadata-based connection between stores

## Future Research Directions

- Custom MRAG pipeline without framework abstractions
- Performance optimization for local deployment
- Integration with newer multi-modal models
- Enhanced evaluation frameworks
- Improved handling of complex document structures

## Key Insights

1. **Modality Independence**: Embeddings should work across different content types
2. **Feature Extraction**: Different approaches for different content types
3. **Storage Strategy**: Dual storage (raw + vector) with proper linking is crucial
4. **Model Selection**: Balance between efficiency and accuracy
